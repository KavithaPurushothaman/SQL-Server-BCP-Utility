# SQL-Server-BCP-Utility

When the data to analyse is so huge (millions of records), it takes a lot of time for import into SQL server. The BCP (Bulk Copy Program) utility is a command line that program that helps in bulk-copying data between a SQL Server and a data file using a special format file. The BCP command is used to create a format file which is an ordinary file with a well-defined structure, and contains metadata about the column such as storage type, prefix length, field length, and field terminator.

Find the sql file to understand the bulk import using BCP!
